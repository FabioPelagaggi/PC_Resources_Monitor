This project aims to create a tool, using the Python programming language, that visually shows the use of the resources of some hardware components. This software shows graphically the percentage of use of the central processing unit, CPU, as well as the main memory and the main storage unit, as well as some other information regarding the computer hardware. To carry out this project, several libraries available for Python were used, such as PYGAME, a library that provides several resources for the development of multimedia software; PSUTIL, a library that provides resources to collect information from the system's hardware; Platform, native Python library that also provides ways to collect information from the operating system and hardware. Thanks to these tools provided by the developer community, the project can be successfully completed.
